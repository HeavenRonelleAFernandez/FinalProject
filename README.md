The javascript quiz works by the user clicking a button to begin the quiz, with a 30-second timer that starts counting down immediately. In answering the questions, the quiz has 5 questions of 4 options, which the user can select an answer and navigation buttons allow the user to move between questions. In submitting the answers, it is color coded, green for the correct answer, red for the incorrect answer, and dark gray for the unselected options, once an answer is submitted, it is not changed. The quiz outputs the score when the timer reaches 0 or the user has submitted all the answers.

The quiz is integrated to the SDG website within the #test container, beneath the home page. In this container, it creates and manages quiz elements. CSS is also applied for visually stunning elements and animations for better user experience.
